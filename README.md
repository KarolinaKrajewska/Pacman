# Pacman
A simple clone of Pacman made in Unity as a project for Game Systems class at Bard College. Made in collaboration with Ngoc Linh Chi Nguyen (linhchi33a on GitHub).

The ghosts are run by a simple AI.

To run in Unity, choose any scene and press "Play".

We have used many resources that cna be found online while making this project:
